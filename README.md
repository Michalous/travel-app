Travel-Tracker App Project


## Description

This is a safety travel tracker app. This app will help you know about the city you are going to travel to. The Travel tracker app will summarize the most important information on the weather and eartquake status of that city and the country.

The travel tracker app gives you up-to-date information on earthquake status and weather conditions. Today, traveling is much more complicated than before, wars, natural disasters, diseases and economic crisis are things we need to think about during travel plans.

Advances in Technology have been proven to be helpful. This Travel tracker app integrated data from two server-side APIs request from openweathermap.org and rapidapi latest earthquake near me apps. We also integrated google map which diplays the map of the city, country and the countires that they shared borders with.

The app was created using agile development methodologies. We implemented feature and bug fixes using git branch workflow and pull requests.
